# PongGame
  Developed a classic arcade-style Pong game using Java, showcasing proficiency in object-oriented programming and
 game development concepts. Implemented core game mechanics such as paddle movement, ball physics, collision
 detection, and scoring system. Utilized Java's Swing, JFrame and JPanel libraries for GUI design. Applied principles of
 modular programming to ensure code scalability and maintainability, facilitating future enhancements and feature
 additions. This project was a true test to my technical skills and proved to myself my deep passion for programming.
